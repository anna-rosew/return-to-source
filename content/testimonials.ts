      "“ Rose came into my life at a traumatic and distressing time.  I've unearthed insights when I didn't think my mind would let me and overcome challenges that I could not see beyond. Through movement, breath and her excellent coaching skills, a sense of calm and peace is restored. I don't know how Rose does it, but she just knows.”",

    testimonial:
      "“I was stuck on a path that made me deeply unhappy - doggedly overworking in the pursuit of external success. Rose sat with me calmly and gently each time it all seemed way too much, and enabled me to have the clarity and courage to continue on the path I knew, in my heart, to be essential.”",

    testimonial:
      "“I first practised yoga with Rose on a retreat in Portugal in 2018. It was the first time I had tried kundalini yoga and I found it released emotions and I felt that it was very healing. I find Rose's online yoga leaves me feeling relaxed, much more aware of the power of my breath and with a heightened awareness.”",

    testimonial:
      "“I really enjoyed being part of the group and I found your Zoom ‘technique’ worked really well. I just had you on the screen while doing the practice, so it felt like a one to one, whilst being aware of the others in the group, all with a common purpose. Emotionally, it felt so lovely to be part of a ‘family’ in spirit.”",
