"I found speaking to Carol illuminating.  Her understanding of relationships and what it means to have a healthy relationship with yourself opened up new perspectives and possibilitis for me.  I encourage you to listen and see what opens up for you.

There is so much I could say about Carol, she is a multi-faceted and inspirational woman.  If you'd like to know a little more about her, check out details of Red Kite, an organisation she co-founded.

Their work envisions psychotherapy playing a vital role in offering and holding sacred space for radical soul work which is now necessary to heal the alienation between our human psyche and the natural world.  Each student is invited to develop deep ecological and spiritual practices to support their own personal well-being and support the work they do as citizens of the Earth and psychotherapists. **<u>[Checkout the RedKite Training Website >>](https://theredkite.net/)</u> **"
