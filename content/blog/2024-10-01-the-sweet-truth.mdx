## Your Relationship with Sugar

You may be able to take it or leave it, or it may have been your first true love. If you have a sweet tooth sugar is a natural fix when you're feeling tired, or in need of comfort. Or you may associate it with enjoying yourself and having fun.

Whatever your relationship and the associations you have with the sweet stuff, we now know just how powerful **sugar** is. Research shows that its affects are as powerful and **addictive** as cocaine, yikes!

What I find helpful to know is how much sugar I'm eating, so the first tip is...

## Measuring Sugar Intake

### Read the Label

Look at the 'carbs as sugars' on the nutrition panel - this includes both natural and added sugars; less than 5g per 100g is **low**, more than 15g per 100g is **high**.

Here are some examples to give you a picture of what we're talking about here:

- A large single biscuit with 18g of sugar is equal to 4 1/2 cubes of sugar.
- A medium sized chocolate bar with 24g of sugar is equal to 6 cubes of sugar
- An 8.3oz can of energy drink with 27g of sugar is equal to 7 cubes of sugar
- One pint of vanilla ice cream with 84g of sugar is equal to 21 cubes of sugar
- A litre of fizzy drink with 124g of sugar is equal to 31 cubes of sugar
- A glass of white wine can contain anything from less than 1g of sugar (less than a quarter of a teaspoon) up to 6g (one and a half teaspoons) per glass.

## Daily Sugar Allowance

There are two types of sugar - naturally occurring sugars and **added sugar**. The recommendations from the World Health (WHO) are that only 5% of your daily calorie intake should consist of added sugars. This equates to approximately five-six teaspoons (25g) for women and seven-eight teaspoons (35g) for men. And many health professionals think this is a little too high for most of us.
