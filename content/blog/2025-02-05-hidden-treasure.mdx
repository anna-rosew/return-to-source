Many of us had an education that was based on the model of the '**expert**' standing at the front of the group to share his/her expertise. In this model education is largely information based, an accumulation of knowledge and the testing of that knowledge. We are judged in relation to the others in the group - who came top, who came bottom, was I better/worse that my peers? It becomes the norm to allow an external evaluator to determine our success or failure.

Maybe this model is breaking down, changing and shifting in the age of technology. But the **hangover** for many of us is the belief that teaching comes from experts, and others know what what we need, others can determine our self worth, and our sense of self esteem is stuck in a dualistic idea of success and failure, and comparing ourselves to others.

And yet when we open ourself to life we recognise that life is constantly bringing us situations that are **opportunities** for learning and growth. These situations are so rich and varied, that we can be blind to their value and the fact that they're available to us every waking minute

When we see every situation as an opportunity for learning and growth it allows us to recognise that **life is the real teacher**. When every situation is a teacher, you cannot fail. Every situation is an opportunity for your growth and development. The sense of being a victim to life transforms into the space of opportunity. Self pity is replaced with **curiosity** and **listening**.

That's not to say that old patterns of feeling a victim to life don't arise, they do, but we recognise them for what they are, and do not feed the victim story and stay stuck.

In my experience, life really does bring me what I need, but the **packaging** can be so unappealing that it takes presence to remember to look. I can easily fall into the unconscious habit of judging it as 'good' or 'bad', 'welcome' or 'unwelcome'.

Maybe the biggest example of this for me was a **cancer diagnosis**. I had moved to Liverpool from London eight weeks earlier and I was all set to begin a 'new life'. It was six weeks before Rob and I were to be married. A cancer diagnosis was bloody unwelcome! It took me a while to be willing to receive what life was handing me - I had fear, I had resistance, I had upset from usurped expectations. I would often fall into victim mode.

But something in me kept reminding me that this experience had come to **teach** me. That remembering came when I gave myself time and space to come back to myself - time on the mat, walking in nature, meaningful conversations with friends, journalling, listening to uplifting music

As I began to engage with the reality of what I was experiencing, I became open and could have **faith** that I wasn't being punished and I wasn't a failure. It was a rollercoaster, but over time the experience taught me everything I'd been longing to learn at the deepest level. From that experience I laid the foundations for my life today. For the first time I listened to my **heart's longing** and gave myself permission to live the life I longed to live. It wasn't easy. I don't have anything cracked. But I can say that experience was a teacher and despite the terrible packaging, an incredible gift.

What is the hidden treasure for you at this time in your life? What is surfacing that feels challenging and unwelcome? Can you hold the perspective (you may be already) that this unwelcome situation holds the opportunity for learning and growth? Are you ready to breathe deep and receive what life is bringing you? Can you be curious and discover the hidden treasure in what is present for you today?

When we sit with what feels unwelcome and challenging, it's like walking into the unknown without a map - scary and disorientating. In the moment, the **breath** will anchor you and allow you to soften and find your way. And in the day, your conscious practices will hold you in the stream of love and life that carries you on your path of learning and growth.

We are in this together. None of us are perfect. We are all messy at times. Really messy!
