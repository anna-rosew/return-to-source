It may be a screensaver on your phone. It may be a password you use throughout the day. It may be something that pops into your mind right now...!"

**It's common that when we commit to something, anything (or anyone), that we consciously or unconsciously create an expectation.** Pause, come back to the **breath**, and look at where you're attached to expectations in an area of your life.

**Someone once told me that expectations are resentments in waiting.** I find this to be largely true. Projecting an idea of what I'd like to happen in the future sets me up for **disappointment**, **judgement** and **resignation**. Why? Because life rarely turns out the way I think it's going to.

I find if life does turn out the way I thought it would, I'm usually in my **critical/shame story**, gathering evidence about myself or another and enjoying the satisfaction of being **right**. Painful and yet strangely satisfying!

**To me expectations are different from a vision.** Where a vision is a **guiding star**, something that I move towards to orientate myself, (like a **compass**), expectations are a quiet fix—if that happens I'll be happy/successful/attractive/healthy/add your own version.

**Holding a vision allows space for life to unfold.** Expectations tend to bring **attachment**, **pressure** and **control**.

Pause and notice whether your expectations are creating any pressure, disappointment, upset or control. If they are, **breathe deep** and let them go. You don't need to hold onto them. You **created** them, you can **release** them.

In the space you create, bring your **vision** for yourself to mind. Breathe deep and see your vision **glowing** like a star. In what direction is it **drawing** you?

Now look at what you're **already doing** that is carrying you in the direction of your vision. Get **specific**. Identify what has **supported** you, and notice what choices have brought **learning** and **growth**—they may have been the ones that caused you pain and discomfort.

Ask yourself how you can **build** on your foundation to keep moving in the direction of your vision? Note down any helpful **reminders**, **pointers**, **insights** and **actions**.
